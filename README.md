# Pewlett-Hackard Analysis
## Overview
Pewlett-Hackard, Inc. (“PH”) is a large organization and wants to better prepare for the large number of retirees that will be leaving the organization in the near future and ongoing.  PH hired Data Analyst Inc (“DAI”) to assist their human resources manager, Bobby, to gather useful employee and job information to help managers plan ahead.  Therefore, DAI has worked with Bobby to gather the following information requested by management:
        
 * The number of retiring PH employees by title
 * The PH employees eligible for a mentorship program

## Results

### Retiring PH Employees by Title 
To accomplish this objective, DAI first identified all employees who are within a soon-to-be retiring age group as those with birthdates between 1952 and 1955.  Along with these employees’ titles, DAI calculated the number of employees retiring by title.  These numbers are as follows:

Retiring PH Employees by Title:

This data tells us:

* There are approximately 90,000 employees targeted to leave the company within 7 job titles or roles.
* The largest job role targeted for retirement is Senior Engineer with 29,414 employees.
* The second largest job role is Senior Staff with 28,254 employees.
* These 2 roles account for 63.8% all retiring employees. 

### Mentoring Program
Due to the large numbers of employees targeted to leave the company, PH managers suggested a mentoring program where current employees with birthdates in the year 1965 would mentor non-retiring employees as a means to ease the transition of current employees into the retiring job roles.  DAI captured these employees and determined:

* There are 1,549 employees born in 1965 that are eligible for the mentoring program.
* This number only represents 1.7% of those in the retiring group (1952 to 1955 birthdates).

It is DAI’s concern the 1965 group is not enough coverage for the mentorship program to be a success and PH may need to consider adding additional employee groups.

## Summary
Hopefully, PH can make some sound judgements with the above information.  In conducting some preliminary meetings, some managers raised the following questions:

1.	What does the pool of retiring employees look like by department? 
2.	What are the numbers of mentoring employees by job role?

Therefore, DAI also provided the following supplements to the above information to further assist managers in their retirement planning.

### Retiring Employees by Title - Supplement
Additionally, DAI determined departmental managers could benefit with the numbers of employees targeted for retirement by department, so DAI ran this data:
 
Retiring PH Employees by Department:

It shows 3 of the 9 PH departments (Development, Production, and Sales) have 52% of the total retiring employees.  For department manager use, this information is also ran by title and by department to identify the roles retiring within department.  This last report was a longer report and was handed out to departmental managers present at the meeting.

### Mentoring Program - Supplement 
DAI took the mentorship data one step further and calculated the number of these employees with birthdates in 1965 by job title.  This analysis will help management have a more direct comparison to job titles targeted for retirement and therefore, those jobs needing mentorship.  The results are:

This data further emphasizes the mentorship eligibility pool is not enough to cover the retiring roles.  Especially in the Senior Engineer category.  There are only 258 Senior Engineers in the 1965 birtdate pool.
